# Climbing_Model
This Repositories is for my research on climbing. And the data I used is based on [Climbing Hold](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tomasslama/indoor-climbing-gym-hold-segmentation/data?select=bh-annotation.csv) and simulated climbers.

# Random Forest
I used Random Forest as my project baseline.
